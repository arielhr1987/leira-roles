Take full control of user roles and capabilities in WordPress with an intuitive, powerful interface.

== Description ==

**Roles & Capabilities** empowers administrators with a complete toolset for managing user roles and capabilities directly from the WordPress admin â€” no code required.

Designed for simplicity and control, this plugin allows you to customize user permissions to fit any use case. Access is strictly limited to site administrators for maximum security; no additional capabilities can grant access to its features.

### Key Features

- Create and manage custom roles.
- Edit role names and assign or remove capabilities.
- Clone existing roles for faster setup.
- Grant or revoke capabilities for individual users.
- Create and assign new custom capabilities.
- Remove user-defined capabilities when no longer needed.

Whether you're building a membership site, managing editorial permissions, or fine-tuning access, this plugin gives you the precision and flexibility you need.

== Development ==

This plugin is open-source and actively maintained.
